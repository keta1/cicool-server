## CiCool vs. "Traditional Words App"

### “Traditional Words App”

Take Momoji words as an example。

1. It needs to be installed, the app size is 200M+, which greatly occupies the user's storage space
2. The number of words is limited, if you want more words, you need to complete the task or buy
3. The number of words is not large enough to meet the needs of users
4. Apps may collect a large amount of user data, and the risk of user privacy leakage is high
5. Need to register an account to use, it is inconvenient to use

### CiCool Practice

CiCool is a WeChat-based applet that runs directly in WeChat。

The advantage of CiCool is that：

1. It can be used without installation, which greatly saves the user's storage space
2. It can be used without registering an account, which is very convenient to use
3. Can be used without purchase, free for users to use
4. There is no need to collect user data, and the risk of user privacy leakage is low
5. The number of words is very large, which can basically meet the needs of users
